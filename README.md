# OOP-Java-Practice

A simple terminal app for creating tasks and sorting them by due date, priority, or estimated hours. Made as a quick refresher on Java foundations and object-oriented programming basics. 

## TODOS:

- Move different task list sorting and printing methods out of the App.java file and over to a new TaskList.java class file.
- finish implementing different task sorting algos.
